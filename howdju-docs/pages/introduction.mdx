# Introduction

If you have ever fact-checked a claim, you know how time-consuming it is. The
steps include:

- Articulating the claim you believe the speaker to be making based upon both
  the literal phrasing and context.
- Considering alternative articulations:
  - Charitable alternatives, that you expect to be more true and might be:
    - what the author meant
    - what the author might agree to if presented with criticism
    - what others might interpret the speech to mean, even if the author
      disagrees
  - Uncharitable alternatives that don't represent the speaker's intent, but
    that others may incorrectly attribute to the speech.
- Depending on whether a claim is a statement of fact or a conclusion drawn from
  an explicit or implied argument, decomposing a claim into other claims that
  form an argument for the conclusion.
- For every claim resulting from this process, searching for evidence weighing
  on the truth of the claim.
- Finally synthesizing the evidence and arguments into a judgment on the
  original claim and the most important alternatives.

Whew! So now you have an informed personal conclusion about the speaker's claim.
What do you do with it?

## What next?

If you embarked on the fact check as part of a conversation, you might report
back your findings to your friends or colleagues. If you are someone with an
active social media presence, you might broadcast your results, and some of your
followers might try to make substantive contributions in the comments. Or if
neither of those things apply, you might not do anything other than hope to
remember your conclusions if it becomes relevant again.

But can we do better? I think we can.

## How Howdju helps

Howdju is a prototype of a platform for crowdsourcing and sharing fact checks.
It lets you store and share your fact checking analysis, allowing others to
discover, evaluate, and contribute to your analysis.

Howdju's [mission](/principles#mission) is to to minimize the time required to
understand representative viewpoints about uncertain or disputed topics by
connecting users with the most relevant and authoritative sources for those
viewpoints.

Howdju users have these opportunities:

* Use a purpose built platform to efficiently track claims and evidence.
* Share their fact check in a structured way online so that their friends or
  colleagues can view, respond, and contribute to their fact checks.
* Get specific structured feedback on the validity of your fact check from wide
  audiences.
* Record personal research so that you can find and refer to it later.

But that's not all!

## A community of truth seekers

In addition to sharing their own fact checks, Howdju users benefit when other
users share their fact checks:

* In context highlighting of debated claims.
* Searchable database of claims and justifications.
* Notifications for fact check activity of users you follow.
