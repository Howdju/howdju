# Design

This page describes Howdju's intended qualities and use cases.

## Intended qualities

Howdju's intended qualities are:

- Convenient: it's easy to input and to access information
- Consolidated: duplicate things are merged and related things are adjacent
- Contextualized: accept and present relevant context empowering users to evaluate the information.
- Charitable: nudge users towards [charitable
  discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity)
- Incremental: allow users to refine their own and others' content (while
  preserving the history.)

## Use cases

Howdju's functionality can be thought of as breaking down into four use cases.
The first use case is foundational because most of the others build on top of it.
The next two are "primary" in the sense that they are the use cases Howdju is
most focused on supporting. And the last one "refinines" the content of the
"primary" use cases.

- Foundational
  - Excerpting: capturing speech in context
- Primary
  - Concluding: deriving conclusions from sources a user finds credible
  - Critiquing: fact checking claims from sources a user finds uncredible
- Refining
  - Analyzing: further analyzing the truth of conclusions or critiques.

Excerpting is foundational and the other two use-cases build off of it.
Concluding and critiquing build on top of excerpting. Whether a user engages
in concluding or critiquing of a source relates to Howdju's
[epistemic mode hypothesis](/design/epistemic-mode-hypothesis).

### Excerpting

*Bookmark meaning*

When you create a [MediaExcerpt](/concepts/media-excerpts), you do more than
bookmark a URL. You bookmark a particular excerpt (quotation) from that URL and
optionally associate a speaker and a bibliographic source with the excerpt.

When you go further and create an [Appearance](/concepts/appearances) or
[Justification](/concepts/justifications) using the MediaExcerpt, you are now
bookmarking your interpretion of the meaning of what was said.

While this use-case has standalone utility (e.g. for rediscovering an excerpt
from a source later by searching for your interpretation), it is also a foundation
for the other use cases.

### Concluding

Use a [MediaExcerpt](/concepts/media-excerpts) as the basis of a
[Justification](/concepts/justifications) to conclude a
[Proposition](/concepts/propositions). This creates evidence-based knowledge
that you can share with others.
Notifications of others' [analysis](#analyzing) will further inform you about
the correctness of your conclusion.

### Critiquing

*Fact checking*

Add [Justifications](/concepts/justifications) to an [Appearance's](/concepts/appearances)
[Proposition](/concepts/propositions) to analyze the credibility of the Source's claims.

### Analyzing

Add [Justifications](/concepts/justifications) to existing [Proposition](/concepts/propositions)
to further analyze their truth.

Note that while it is possible to analyze Propositions apart from any evidentiary context,
Howdju [nudges users](/design/features#evidence-nudges) towards evidence-based knowledge.

## Summarizing

Summarizing is a fifth potential use-case under the heading of "refinement", but
Howdju's functionality currently does not focus on it.

- Create one or more [Appearances](/concepts/appearances) in a [Source](/concepts/sources)
- use the Appearances' [Propositions](/concepts/propositions) to
[Justify](/concepts/justifications) new Propositions that summarize the thinking
or arguments in sections of the source.
- Create new Appearances for the summarizing Propositions where the source explicitly states or
implies the conclusions.

## Going deeper

To learn more you can visit:

- [The features page](/design/features) to see how Howdju's specific features
  serve these use-cases.
- [The comparison page](/design/comparisons) to understand how Howdju compares to
  other platforms.
