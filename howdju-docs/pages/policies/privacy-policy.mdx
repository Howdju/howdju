This Privacy Policy explains how Howdju (“we”, “us”) collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our Services or when you otherwise interact with us or receive a communication from us.

This Privacy Policy is part of our [User Agreement](/policies/user-agreement).

## What we collect

### Information you provide to ys

We collect information you provide to us directly when you use the Services. This includes:

#### Account information

If you create a Howdju account, we may require you to provide a username and password. Your username is public, and it doesn’t have to be related to your real name. You may also provide other account information, such as your name, an email address, a biography, a profile picture, or links to web properties that represent you. We also store account preferences and settings that you can view and change using our Services.

#### Content you submit

We collect the content you submit to the Services. This content includes your propositions and justifications, including any content that may appear to you in draft or private form, your messages with other users, and your reports and other communications with us. Your content may include text, links, images, gifs, and videos.

When you submit content to Howdju, such as propositions, citations, or when you vote on Howdju's content, these actions may reflect personal information that may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in certain jurisdictions, such as your political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs. By choosing to take these actions or provide this content, you consent to our processing of that information.

#### Actions you take

We collect information about the actions you take when using the Services. This includes your interactions with content, like voting and reporting. We may monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service.

#### Other information

You may choose to provide other information directly to us. For example, we may collect information when you fill out a form, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us.

### Information we collect automatically

When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about you. This includes:

#### Log and usage data

We may log information when you access and use the Services. This may include your IP address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system, referral URLs, device information, device settings, and actions taken using the Services, such as pages visited, links clicked, URLs visiting, and search terms. Except for the IP address used to create your account, Howdju will delete any IP addresses collected after 90 days.

#### Information collected from cookies and similar technologies

We may receive information from cookies, which are pieces of data your browser stores and sends back to us when making requests, and similar technologies such as session and local storage. We use this information to improve your experience, understand user activity, personalize content, and improve the quality of our Services. For example, we store and retrieve an authentication token so that you don’t need to login to the Services every time you start an application. See our Cookie Notice for more information about how Howdju uses cookies. For more information on how you can disable cookies, please see “Your Choices” below.

### Information collected by third parties

#### Third party service providers

Howdju uses third parties to provide services as described in our Cookie Policy.

## How we use information about you

We use information about you to:

- Provide, maintain, and improve the Services;
- Research and develop new services;
- Help protect the safety of Howdju and our users, which includes blocking suspected spammers, addressing abuse, and enforcing the Howdju User Agreement and our other policies;
- Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, invoices, and other support and administrative messages;
- Provide customer service;
- Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, and events, and provide other news and information we think will be of interest to you (for information about how to opt out of these communications, see “Your Choices” below);
- Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services;
- Personalize the Services, and provide and optimize content, and features that match user profiles or interests.

Much of the information on the Services is public and accessible to the public internet, without viewers creating or logging in with an account. By using the Services, you are directing us to share this information publicly and freely.

When you submit content to a public part of the Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see that content, the username associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted the content.

Your Howdju account has a profile page that is public. Your profile contains information about your activities on the Services, such as your username, public content, and how long you have been a member of the Services.

Howdju only shares personal information about you in the following ways. We do not sell this information.

- **With your consent**. We may share information about you with your consent or at your direction.
- **With our service providers**. We may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work for us. Their use of personal data will be subject to appropriate confidentiality and security measures. A few examples: (i) cloud providers who host our data and our services, (ii) error reporting services that receive information about errors you encounter on the site to help us diagnose and fix errors.
- **To comply with the law**. We may share information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, including, but not limited to, meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. To the extent the law allows it, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request.
- **In an emergency**. We may share information if we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.
- To enforce our policies and rights. We may share information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our User Agreement, Code of Conduct, or other Howdju policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others.
- **With our affiliates**. We may share information between and among Howdju, and any of our parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.
- **Aggregated or de-identified information**. We may share information about you that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may show the total number of times a post has been upvoted without identifying who the visitors were.

## How We Protect Your Information

We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we use HTTPS while information is being transmitted. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees have access to nonpublic personal information.

We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.

## Your Choices

You have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and sharing of information about you when you use the Services. Some of these choices are available to everyone who uses Howdju, while others only apply if you have a Howdju account.

### Accessing and Changing Your Information

You can access and change certain information through the Services, such as through settings pages
we provide. You can request a copy of the personal information Howdju maintains about you by
emailing us at <EmailAddress username="data-requests" /> from the email address that you have verified with your
Howdju account.

### Deleting your account

You may delete your account at any time from the user preferences page. When you delete your account, your profile will be replaced by an anonymous pseudo account profile page that continues to list the content previously associated with your account. The content you submitted prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others, and will appear associated with this pseudo account.

Your paid contribution disclosure will remain on the pseudo account page. We may also retain certain information about you as required by law or for legitimate business purposes after you delete your account.

### Disassociating content from your account

You may disassociate content you created from your account at any time. This content will appear associated with an anonymized pseudo account. All content that you disassociate from your account will be associated with the same pseudo account.

### Controlling the Use of Cookies

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. For more information on controlling how cookies and similar technologies are used on Howdju, see our Cookie Notice.

### Controlling Analytics

Some analytics providers we partner with may provide specific opt-out mechanisms and we may provide, as needed and as available, additional tools and third-party services that allow you to better understand cookies and how you can opt out. For example, you may manage the use and collection of certain information by Google Analytics via the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.

### Do Not Track

Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the sites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. However, there is no accepted standard for how a site should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal. Instead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of information about you.

### Transactional communications

You agree to receive transactional communications from Howdju, including communications sent by phone, email, text message, or other means of communication. If you provided a phone number to Howdju, you are required to notify Howdju when you cease to own or control that number to help prevent Howdju from sending communications to others who may acquire that number.

### Controlling Promotional Communications

You may opt out of receiving some or all categories of promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those communications or by updating your email options in your account preferences. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as information about your account or your use of the Services.

## Your Rights

### Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests

You can make a request under a data protection law by sending the request to <EmailAddress
username="data-requests" /> from the email address that you have verified with your
Howdju account. Please include the purpose of the request, any laws you know to be related to your
request, the applicable dates for the request, and any additional information that explains the
nature and extent of the information you are requesting.

Howdju does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection laws to make requests regarding their personal information.

## Data processing locality

We are based in the United States and we process and store information on servers located in the United States. We may store information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service providers. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer, and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, where you may not have the same rights as you do under local law.

## Children

Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to create an account or otherwise use the Services. All users must be over the age required by the laws of their locality to enter into legally binding agreements and to provide the information described in this Policy. Persons requiring consent from a parent or guardian to do any of these things may not use the Services.

## Changes to This Policy

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will let you know by revising the date at the top of the policy. If the changes, in our sole discretion, are material, we may also notify you by sending an email to the address associated with your account (if you have chosen to provide an email address) or by otherwise providing notice through our Services. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access or use our Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. By continuing to use our Services after Privacy Policy changes go into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised policy.
