## What are cookies and how does Howdju use them?

A cookie is a small data file that a site stores on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. Browsers support cookies and similar technologies (such as local storage and pixels) so that a site like Howdju can remember information about your visit and can use the information to improve your experience and to create aggregated anonymized statistics about usage of the site. In this Notice, we use the term “cookie” to refer both to cookies and similar technologies.

Cookies may be set by the site you are visiting (called “first-party cookies”) or by a third party, such as those who provide analytics or advertising services or interactive content on the site (“third-party cookies”).

Our first-party cookies include cookies that are strictly necessary, functional cookies, support cookies, and cookies related to analytics/performance.

- **Strictly Necessary**: These cookies are technically required. These cookies include cookies to persist your privacy settings.
- **Functional**: These cookies enable Howdju to provide basic functionality and personalization. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these features may not function properly. These cookies include cookies to store an authentication token so that you don’t need to provide your account credentials each time you load the website.
- **Analytics/Performance**: These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site.

## Third-party's services

Howdju uses third parties to provide services that may set cookies on your machine to improve your
experience with the services. Howdju does not control how third party services collect data when
they serve their content. Howdju does not directly provide any personally identifiable information
to these services. We generate special-purpose distinct unique identifiers to connect any activity
on Howdju.com with information recorded by these services. If you explicitly enter your personal
information, such as name or email address, when using these services then this information may be
transmitted directly to these services. If you enable Full error reporting, you might also transmit
personal identifiers that are used shortly before an error is reported.

Examples of third party service providers we use include:

- Google Analytics: allows us to analyze anonymized usage data
- Sentry.io error monitoring: allows us to monitor any errors that occur on the site and to fix them
