Last Updated 6 July 2021

Hello truthseekers! Howdju's mission is to minimize the time required to
understand representative viewpoints about uncertain or disputed topics. This
User Agreement and your conduct make that possible.

This Howdju User Agreement (“Terms”) applies to your access to and use of the
websites, APIs, mobile apps, and extensions, and other online products and
services (collectively, the “Services”) provided by Carl Gieringer, an
individual, (“Howdju,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).

By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you
do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use our Services.

Please note that these Terms incorporate several other documents, the additional
terms of which you agree to when you agree to these Terms:

- The [Code of Conduct](/policies/code-of-conduct) explains how best to use
  Howdju, as well as things you cannot do with Howdju.
- The [Privacy Policy](/policies/privacy-policy) explains what personal
  information we collect and how we use it.
- The [Cookie Notice](/policies/cookie-notice) goes into detail about how we use
  cookies and related technologies.

## 1. Your Access to the Services

Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to create an account or otherwise
use the Services. All users must be over the age required by the laws of their
locality to enter into legally binding agreements and to provide the information
described in this Agreement. Persons requiring consent from a parent or guardian
to do any of these things may not use the Services.

The Services may only be used in an individual capacity. Persons may not accept
these Terms on behalf of another legal entity, including a business or
government entity.

Persons located in the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA), or
in any other jurisdiction that is subject to the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR), are not allowed to create a Howdju account or to submit
content to the services.

## 2. Your Use of the Services

Howdju grants you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable,
limited license to use and access the Services solely as permitted by these
Terms. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you by these Terms.

Except as permitted through the Services or as otherwise permitted by us in
writing, your license does not include the right to:

- license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially
  exploit the Services or Content;
- modify, prepare derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, or reverse
  engineer any part of the Services or Content; or
- access the Services or Content in order to build a similar or competitive
  website, product, or service that is for-profit — members of not-for-profit
  organizations developing non-commercial products may use the services for
  comparitive purposes.

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (in whole
or in part) at any time, with or without notice to you. Any future release,
update, or other addition to functionality of the Services will be subject to
these Terms, which may be updated from time to time. You agree that we will not
be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or
discontinuation of the Services or any part thereof.

## 3. Your Howdju Account and Account Security

To use certain features of our Services, you may be required to create a Howdju
account (an “Account”) and provide us with a username, password, and certain
other information about yourself as set forth in the [Privacy
Policy](/policies/privacy-policy). Accounts may not belong to or be used by
corporations or government entities.

You are allowed to have one and only one Howdju account at any time. Each Howdju
account may only be used by a single accountable person. You may not create
another account, even if your account is suspended or restricted in any way. If
your account has been suspended, you must wait until the suspension expires
before you can use that account.

You may create another account one month after deleting an account. If your
account was suspended or restricted at the time you deleted your account, then
the suspension or restriction period will continue to elapse, and will apply to
any new account you may create until the suspension or restriction expires.

You must safeguard your account credentials, and you must not share the account
credentials with anyone. You must immediately notify Howdju if you discover or
suspect that someone has accessed your Account. We recommend that you use a
strong password that is used only with your Account.

You are solely responsible for the content associated with your Howdju Account
and anything that happens related to it.

## 4. Your Content

The Services may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos, videos, or
other materials (“Content”), including Content created or submitted to the
Services by you or through your Account (“Your Content”). We take no
responsibility for and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, support, or
guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any of
Your Content.

By submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you
have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your
Content contained within these Terms and that it will not violate any law or the
rights of any person.

Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to
liability if you post or share Content illegally or without all necessary
rights.

You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant Howdju
the following license to use that Content:

When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a
worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable,
and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works
of, distribute, store, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username,
voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats
and channels now known or later developed anywhere in the world. This license
includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication,
broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or
individuals who partner with Howdju. You also agree that we may remove metadata
associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and
assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.

You also grant a limited non-exclusive, royalty-free license to other Howdju
users to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit,
display, and distribute any content posted by you to the Services solely in
connection with that user’s use of the Services. The licenses granted by you
hereunder do not include any moral rights or right of attribution.

Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about Howdju or our Services that you
provide to us are entirely voluntary, and you agree that Howdju may use such
ideas, suggestions, and feedback without compensation or obligation to you.

Although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor Your Content, we may,
in our sole discretion, delete, remove, or hide Your Content at any time and for
any reason, including for violating these Terms, violating our Code of Conduct,
or if you otherwise create or are likely to create liability for us.

Any invitation made by Howdju to you to use the Services or submit content to
the Services, or the fact that Howdju may receive a benefit from your use of the
Services or provision of content to the Services, will not obligate Howdju to
maintain any content or maintain your access to the Services. Howdju will have
no liability to you for removing any content, for terminating your access to the
Services, or for modifying or terminating the Services.

## 5. Things You Must Not Do

When using or accessing Howdju, you must comply with these Terms and all
applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Please review the Code of Conduct,
which are part of these Terms and contain Howdju’s rules about prohibited

## 10. Governing Law, Venue and Duration of Claims

These terms are governed by the laws of Washington State, United States of
America. You assent to jurisdiction of the courts of King County, Washington
State, United States of America. You agree that the laws of the State of
Washington and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the United States of
America, will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any legal claim that might
arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles). You
agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper
in, the courts located in King County, Washington, in any legal action or
proceeding relating to us or these Terms.

If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States
using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the
controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not
apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any
action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of
America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal
law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of
Washington (excluding choice of law).

To ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that
regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action
you might have arising out of or related to use of our services or these Terms
must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one
(1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action
could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever barred).

## 11. Changes to these Terms

We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we
will post the revised Terms and update the Effective Date above. If the changes,
in our sole discretion, are material, we may also notify you by sending an email
to the address associated with your Account (if you have chosen to provide an
email address) or by otherwise providing notice through our Services. By
continuing to access or use the Services on or after the Effective Date of the
revised Terms, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree
to the revised Terms, you must stop accessing and using our Services before the
changes become effective.

## 12. Additional Terms

Because we offer a variety of Services, you may be asked to agree to additional
terms before using a specific product or service offered by Howdju (“Additional
Terms”). To the extent any Additional Terms conflict with these Terms, the
Additional Terms govern with respect to your use of the corresponding Service.

## 13. Termination

You may terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your
Account and discontinuing use of all Services. If you stop using the Services
without deleting your Account, your Account may be deactivated due to prolonged
inactivity.

We may suspend or terminate your Account or ability to access or use the
Services at any time for any or no reason, including for violating these Terms
or our Code of Conduct.

The following sections will survive any termination of these Terms or of your
Account: 4 (Your Content), 5 (Things You Cannot Do), 7 (Indemnity), 8
(Disclaimers), 9 (Limitation of Liability), 10 (Governing Law and Venue), 13
(Termination), and 14 (Miscellaneous).

## 17. Miscellaneous

These Terms do not create an employment, agency, partnership, or joint venture
relationship between you Howdju. These Terms constitute the entire agreement
between you and us regarding your access to and use of the Services. Our failure
to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as
a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision or part of a provision of
these Terms is found unlawful, invalid, void, or unenforceable, that provision
or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and will be
enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and all other provisions of these
Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer any
of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent. We may
freely assign any of our rights and obligations under these Terms.
