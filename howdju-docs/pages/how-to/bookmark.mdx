# How to 'bookmark thought' on Howdju

Add what you've read to Howdju to make it easier to find later and to help others
discover it.

* Install the Chrome extension (optional; you can also copy/paste text anchor links or copy/paste
  the link and text separately.)
* Create a MediaExcerpt, including Source and Speaker.
* Optionally create a Proposition Appearance

Now you can find the source later:

* Searching by the domain
* Searching for statements by the speaker.
* If you added a Proposition Appearance: using semantic search on the Proposition.
