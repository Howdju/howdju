## Use cases

- Bookmark meaning

  When you create a MediaExcerpt, you do more than bookmark a URL. You save a quotation, a URL, and
  optionally a speaker and a source.

  If you create an Appearance or Justification using the MediaExcerpt, you are now saving the
  meaning of what was said.

- Critique sources

  Create Appearances in a Source and then add Justifications to the Propositions to decide whether
  the Source's claims are credible.

- Research a Proposition

  Create a proposition and then add Justifications to it from various sources to decide whether it's
  true, false, or maybe unknown.

## Privacy

Howdju shows the creator for most entities. Therefore most content users create on Howdju is
attributable to them. Votes are generally not attributable to their creators. The exceptions to this
are:

- When there is just one vote on an entity, Howdju currently does not obfuscate the vote count and
  so it could be inferred to the creator of the content.
- Howdju is exploring Fact Checks which use a User's vote on a MediaExcerpt locator to determine
  inclusion in the Fact Check. This approach implicitly exposes the users vote on the locator to
  other users.
