# Epistemic modes hypothesis

Howdju hypothesizes that people engage with information in one of two ways:

1. Constructively: they trust a source and will incorporate its claims into
   their beliefs.
2. Critically: they distrust a source and will hypothesize arguments against its
   claims.

This table summarizes this hypothesis:

| Source Judgment | Epistemic Mode | Argumentative Activity | Howdju Action               |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Credible        | Constructive   | Evidence               | Justify a proposition       |
| Uncredible      | Critical       | Fact check             | Paraphrase to a proposition |

See [this section comparing MediaExcerpt-based justifications to
Appearances](/concepts/justifications#media-excerpt-based-justifications-vs-appearances)
for a practical outcome of this hypothesis.
