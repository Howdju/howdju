# Howdju's Features

import { Feature } from "../../components/Feature.mdx";

This page gives an overview of Howdju's features.

## Pages

### Justifications page

The justifications page is a single place to see the reasons for and against
a particular thing being true.

The justification page has a single focused entity, which is the subject of truth.
Under the focused entity are two columns: on the left are justifications
supporting the truth of the focused entity and on the right are justifications
against.

The focused entity has an optional [ContextTrail](#contexttrail) showing how The
user navigated to the page.

#### Sorting

Justifications are currently sorted using a global sum of the votes for and
against.

### Recent activity page

The recent activity page shows all entities ordered by descending creation time.

In the future I'd like to combine recent activity into a single feed, consolidating
entities that subsume each other (i.e. only show a single appearance and not the Appearance,
Proposition, and MediaExcerpt separately.)

### Main search page

Supported search types:

- Full-text: if you enter regular text, the search will be over full-text of all supported entities.
- URL: will search MediaExcerpts for those associated with the URL.
- domain: will search MediaExcerpts for those associated with a URL ending with the domain.

### Explore page

A quick way to see all tags and URL domains used anywhere in Howdju.

### Persorg page

- See all of a [Persorg](/concepts/persorgs)'s statements
- <Feature>Track speaker reputation/credibility</Feature>

## Components

### ContextTrail

The ContextTrail shows the entities visited to arrive at the currently focused
entity. Links that users share include the ContextTrail.

The ContextTrail helps users to keep track of their navigation. Contrast this
feature with [two-dimensional maps](/design/comparisons#two-dimensional-maps)
which achieve this context using a two-dimensional space.

#### ContextTrail history

The <Feature>ContextTrailHistory</Feature> shows the user's recent ContextTrails
to help them move between deep contexts. It might operate like a stack (push/pop/switch)

### Tags

Tags provide a way to relate content by themes that are not immediately obvious
from their content. Users can discover tags by searching or by finding them
attached to content they are already viewing. Clicking on the tag shows the
user other related content.

## Behaviors

### Notifications

<Feature issueId="480">Notifications</Feature> alert users about interesting events on
Howdju.

### Text fragment link support

MediaExcerpts having quotations will construct text fragment links from the quotation
and URL. Clicking on these links in supported browsers scrolls directly to the
quotation on the page.

### Preferred phrasing

These two features will contribute to both charitable discourse and incremental
refinement:

- [Preferred-phrasing
  CounterJustifiations](/concepts/justifications#preferred-phrasing-counterjustification)
- <Feature>Preferred-phrasing Proposition Relation</Feature>

### Evidence nudges

<Feature>Evidence Distance</Feature> is a metric quantifying both the number and
distance from a Proposition to justifications based on MediaExcerpts. In the
future the metric may include the quality of the evidence.

The <Feature>Vetting Metric</Feature> quantifies how many people who disagree with
an entity have viewed it. It is a proxy to understand whether the absence of
contradictory content is indicative that contradictory content does not exist.

# Clients

- Browser extension
- Mobile app

## Visibility

Howdju shows the creator for most entities. Therefore most content users create
on Howdju is attributable to them. Votes are generally not attributable to their
creators. The exceptions to this are:

- When there is just one vote on an entity, Howdju currently does not obfuscate
  the vote count and so it could be inferred to the creator of the content.
- Howdju is exploring Fact Checks which use a User's vote on a MediaExcerpt
  locator to determine inclusion in the Fact Check. This approach implicitly
  exposes the users vote on the locator to other users.
