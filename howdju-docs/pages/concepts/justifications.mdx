# Justifications

A justification is when one thing makes another thing more likely to be valid or true. A
justification represents a userâ€™s intention to express or a belief in a relationship between a basis
and an target. The basis is the starting point and the target is the conclusion arrived at by
inference.

Justifications represent a grounded implication of the truth of some target. One type of target is a
proposition: the justification represents reasons for believing that the proposition is true or
false. The basis may be external evidence or other propositions on the platform.

Justifications are the foundation of knowledge construction.

## Components

A Justification is technically a relation between a `basis` and a `target`. The
`basis` provides the evidentiary support for the Justification and the target is the thing
which about which truth is being proven. The Justification's `polarity` determines the direction
of the Justification is arguing for.

Justifications can have one of two bases: MediaExcerpts or PropositionCompounds.

## MediaExcerpt-based Justifications

A MediaExcerpt-based Justification argues for or against the truth of its target based upon a
reference to an external Source. MediaExcerpt-based Justifications are similar to when online
authors make a claim and then hyperlink to another online source implying that the linked source
provides evidence for the truth of their claim.

Howdju's MediaExcerpt-based Justifications improve on 'implication by hyperlink' by explicitly
recording the excerpt of the source that the Justification creator intended to provide the evidence.
This explicitness speeds up readers review of the Justification.

### MediaExcerpt-based Justifications vs. Appearances

It would have been possible to omit MediaExcerpt-based Justifications and to have only
PropositionCompound-based justifications and Appearances. This approach would have required users to
create very precisely worded Appearances so that they could then use them in their Justification.

Howdju wanted to support people who were in a constructive mindset ("I trust this source and/or
speaker, and therefore I believe it to imply the truth of the proposition") rather than forcing them
into a critical mindset. This design decision is to allow these users the convenience of quickly
adding the inferences into Howdju that they are observing as they read.

Howdju is designed to facilitate criticism of these MediaExcerpt-based Justifications when users
create Appearances at the MediaExcerpt and disprove the truth of those appearing Propositions.

Inferential leap.

## PropositionCompound-based Justifications

PropositionCompound-based justifications are like arguments in propositional logic. The Propositions
in the compound (the "atoms") should, combined with the knowledge and judgment of the reader,
require the target to be true if all of the atom Propositions are true.

PropositionCompound-based justifications should be 'necessary and sufficient' to prove their
Justification:

- Sufficient: taken together, the truth of the atoms proves the Justification
- Necessary: removing any atom would defeat the inferential power of the Justification

## CounterJustifications

A Justification can target another Justification and is called counter-Justification. The
counter-Justification does not target the basis of the Justification directly. Instead, a
counter-Justification defeats its target Justification in the particular context where the target
Justificatcion appears.
