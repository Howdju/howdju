# Justifications

import { Feature } from "../../components/Feature.mdx";

A justification is something that makes another thing more likely either to be true or false.

Justifications are the foundation of knowledge construction because they represent deriving
knowledge (the justification's target) based upon existing knowledge (the justification's basis.)

## Components

A Justification is technically a relation between a `basis` and a `target`. The
`basis` provides the evidentiary support for the Justification and the target is the thing
which about which truth is being proven. The Justification's `polarity` determines the direction
of the Justification is arguing for.

## Target types

Howdju currently supports one type of Justification, with others planned.

### Proposition

Proposition Justifications provide reasons for believing in the truth of a
Proposition.

### Appearance

<Feature>Appearance Justifications</Feature> provide reasons for interpreting a
[MediaExcerpt](/concepts/media-excerpts) as an appearance of its Apparition.

### Relation

<Feature>Relation Justifications</Feature> provide reasons for believing that a
[Relation](/concepts/relations) holds between two other entities. The types of
the entities and the meaning of the Relation depend on the specific type of
Relation.

## Basis types

Justifications can have one of two bases: MediaExcerpts or PropositionCompounds.

### MediaExcerpt-based Justifications

A MediaExcerpt-based Justification argues for or against the truth of its target based upon a
reference to an external Source. MediaExcerpt-based Justifications are similar to when online
authors make a claim and then hyperlink to another online source implying that the linked source
provides evidence for the truth of their claim.

Howdju's MediaExcerpt-based Justifications improve on 'implication by hyperlink' by explicitly
recording the excerpt of the source that the Justification creator intended to provide the evidence.
This explicitness speeds up readers review of the Justification.

#### MediaExcerpt-based Justifications vs. Appearances

It would have been possible to omit MediaExcerpt-based Justifications and to have only
PropositionCompound-based justifications and Appearances. This approach would have required users to
create very precisely worded Appearances so that they could then use them in their Justification.

Howdju wanted to support people who were in a constructive mindset ("I trust this source and/or
speaker, and therefore I believe it to imply the truth of the proposition") rather than forcing them
into a critical mindset. See [the Epistemic Mode Hypothesis](/design/epistemic-mode-hypthesis) for
background.

This design decision is to allow these users the convenience of quickly
adding the inferences into Howdju that they are observing as they read. Do you sometimes experience
an inferential leap while reading a source you trust? I.e. "if this is true, which it probably is,
then it is good evidence for this other thing".

Howdju is designed to facilitate criticism of these MediaExcerpt-based Justifications when users
create Appearances at the MediaExcerpt and <Feature issueId="694">disprove the truth of those
appearing Propositions.</Feature>

### PropositionCompound-based Justifications

PropositionCompound-based justifications are like arguments in propositional logic. The Propositions
in the compound (the "atoms") should, combined with the knowledge and judgment of the reader,
require the target to be true if all of the atom Propositions are true.

PropositionCompound-based justifications should be 'necessary and sufficient' to prove their
Justification:

- Sufficient: taken together, the truth of the atoms proves the Justification
- Necessary: removing any atom would defeat the inferential power of the Justification

### Example-based Justifications

<Feature issueId="168">Example-based justifications</Feature> are a special type
of Justification handling the case where one or more examples of a target are given
to imply the Justification's truth valence.

- At most one example-based justification per target per polarity.
- User's vote independently on the Justification and the Examples.

A vote for an Example means "this is an example that contributes to my belief in
the justification's polarity on the target." A vote against an example means "this
is not an example that contributes to my belief in the justification's polarity on the target".
That may mean that the user disagrees that the example is a valid example or just
that it is not one that contributes to a conclusion.

A vote for the justification means:

- Positive: the examples I have voted on and/or seen convinced me to conclude
  the justification's polarity about the target.
- Negative: the examples I have voted on and/or seen have not convienced me to
  conclude the justification's polarity about the target. The user may
  optionally receive <Feature issueId="480">[notifications](/design/features#notifications)</Feature> for new examples.

Example-based justifications are a sub-type of a contributory justification
where the basis of the justification must be an example of the target.

## Polarities

A Justification's polarity indicates whether the basis makes the target true,
false, or niether. Possibly Polarity values are:

- Positive
- Negative
- <Feature issueId="33">Neutral</Feature>

The meaning of a Polarity is target-specific:

| Target | Positive Meaning | Neutral meaning | Negative meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Proposition | The proposition is true | The proposition is neither true nor false | The proposition is false |
| Appearance | The apparition appears at the MediaExcerpt | N/A | The apparition does not appear at the Media Excerpt |
| Relation | The relation holds | N/A | The relation does not hold |

A Polarity is a permanent feature of a Justification. If a user wants to create
an otherwise identical Justification with a different polarity, they must
create a new Justification.

## Strengths

A Justification's <Feature issueId="692">Strength</Feature> indicates how
thoroughly a Justification's basis proves the polarity about the target. Strengths
have two possible values:

- Conclusive: the justification's basis is sufficient to prove the polarity about
  the target.
- Contributory: the justification's basis makes the polarity more likely about
  the target, but does not prove it.

The creator of a Justification provides an initial Strength. Justification voters
can vote with a non-default strength from a dropdown. The default strength presented
to the user is a function of the user's inferred beliefs compared to the inferred
beliefs of users who have voted on the Justification and the weight those voters
selected.

## CounterJustifications

A Justification can target another Justification and is called counter-Justification. The
counter-Justification does not target the basis of the Justification directly. Instead, a
counter-Justification defeats its target Justification in the particular context where the target
Justificatcion appears.

### Preferred-phrasing CounterJustification

A CounterJustification focusing on a Proposition may have
<Feature issueId="528">a special basis type of "preferred phrasing"</Feature>.
The basis type indicates that while the countered justification may be effective
on the current Proposition's phrasing, it loses strength against the proposed
alternative Proposition. This feature enables redirecting attention to a
steelman.
