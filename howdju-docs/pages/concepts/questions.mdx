# Questions

Users can create Propositions with a boolean attribute set 'isQuestion'. When this
Proposition is displayed, it will include a note that the user created it as a question
rather than as a statement of fact.

Although all Propositions should be considered as open to question, this feature
allows creators to distance themselves from the content of controversial Propositions
that may otherwise be necessary for logical exploration of a topic.

## Moods

Although Howdju does not capture all illocutionary force, the question feature is intended
roughly to capture moods such as speculative, interrogative, hypothetical, and dubitative.

The Appearance feature supports the quotative evidential mood.

Roughly ordered by strength of belief, with “most strong belief of truth” at the top.

| Mood                 | Meaning                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Declarative Mood     | signals that the proposition expressed by a speaker’s utterance is offered as an unqualified statement of fact.             |
| Alethic Modality     | connotes the speaker’s estimation of the logical necessity or possibility of the proposition expressed by his utterance.    |
| Deductive Mood       | the speaker judges from other facts that the proposition expressed by his utterance is probably true.                       |
| Speculative Mood     | signals that the speaker judges from certain facts that the proposition expressed by his or her utterance is possibly true. |
| Interrogative Mood   | the speaker wishes to elicit information concerning the content of his or her utterance from the addressee.                 |
| Hypothetical Mood    | the speaker evaluates a proposition as counterfactual, but otherwise possible.                                              |
| Quotative Evidential | Someone else is the source of the statement made.                                                                           |
| Dubitative Mood      | signals a speaker’s reservation about the accuracy of his or her statement                                                  |
| Deontic              | Signals a desire for the world to be a certain way.                                                                         |
