# Relations

Relations are assertions about two entities having a relationship. For example,
the relation `PropositionEquivalence` asserts that two Propositions are equivalent. Both users and
automated processes can create relations. Users can vote on the validity of relations.

Howdju has not implemented relations yet, but the first two are likely to be
`PropositionEquivalence` and `JustificationEquivalence`. Howdju will use these relations to
display different entities in a combined way.
