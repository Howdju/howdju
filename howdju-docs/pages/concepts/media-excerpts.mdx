# MediaExcerpts

Media Excerpts are references to a part of some media external to Howdju. Conceptually
they can be thought of containing two types of things: local represenatations and remote locators:

- Local representations allow users to assess the evidentiary quality of the excerpt without leaving Howdju.
- Remote locators allow users to access the excerpt in its original context.

MediaExcerpts unlock:

- Analyzing the meaning of contextualized speech
  - Debating what a speaker intended to mean
  - Analyzing the truth of the underlying meaning
- Semantic search and clustering
  - Rediscover this context by searching for the meaning you interpreted to it.
  - Find related thought appearing in different contexts

## Citations

Citations are remote locators that use bibliographic source citations to locate excerpts.
They enable locating material which may not be available online or which the user may not know how
to find online.

Citations consist of a Source and an optional Pincite.

### Sources

Sources are like bibliographic sources that would appear in a research paper. They have a textual
description, which is MLA-like except that it omits the authors.

Source's vs. Source containers

### Pincites

A Citation may optionally contain a Pincite which is a textual directive to help a user locate
(“pinpoint”) a MediaExcerpt in a cited Source.

Examples of Pincites include:

- Page number
- Video/Audio timestamp

## Speakers

A MediaExcept may be associated with one or more speakers.

### Persorgs

Persorgs are something capable of making speech: a natural person or an organization.
