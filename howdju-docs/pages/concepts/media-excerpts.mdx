# MediaExcerpts

Media Excerpts are references to a part of some media external to Howdju. Their
primary purpose is in [Appearances](/concepts/appearances) where they anchor
a Howdju entity with a specific part of an external Source. They also have
standalone utility for 'highlighting' a specific quote from a webpage or book.

MediaExcerpts unlock:

- Analyzing the meaning of contextualized speech
  - Debating what a speaker intended to mean
  - Analyzing the truth of the underlying meaning
- Semantic search and clustering
  - Rediscover this context by searching for the meaning you interpreted to it.
  - Find related thought appearing in different contexts

A MediaExcerpt's components:

- Quotation
- URL(s)
- Citation(s)
- Speakers

A MediaExcerpt's components serve two purposes:

- Local representation: allows users to evaluate the evidentiary
  quality of an excerpt without leaving Howdju
- Remote location: allows users to find and view the excerpt in its original context.

## Quotation

The MediaExcerpt's quotation is the specific part of the source the user intended to reference.

## URL

The URL is the online location where the MediaExcerpt can be found.

## Citations

Citations are bibliographic information. They enable MediaExcerpts of offline
sources. Their information also provides context to users.

Citations consist of a Source and an optional Pincite.

### Sources

Sources are bibliographic information similar to what someone would include in
an academic paper when citing another authority. Howdju recommends an MLA-like
style except omitting the authors since those correspond to [speakers](#speakers).

- Title (the specific name of the article)
- Publication (i.e. the name of the newspaper, journal, etc.)
- Publication date

### Pincites

A Citation may optionally contain a Pincite which is a textual directive to help a user locate
(“pinpoint”) a MediaExcerpt in a cited Source.

Examples of Pincites include:

- Page number
- Video/Audio timestamp

## Speakers

Users may associate one or more speakers with a MediaExcept to indicate the
[Persorg](/concepts/persorg)(s) that are directly responsible for the speech in
the MediaExcerpt.
