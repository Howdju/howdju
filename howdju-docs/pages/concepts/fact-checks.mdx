# FactChecks

From an Appearance, you can click on the context menu for "User's fact-check". This
will take you to a page which accepts sourceIds, urlIds, and userIds. The page will
show you all Appearances that reference any of the source(s) or URL(s) created by any of the user(s).

Users can add Appearances to these results by clicking on the context menu for "Confirm this Appearance".

I will be adding additional functionality to this page, such as a summary of the users'
votes on Justifications on the Propositions in the Appearances. I will also explore making a
specific FactCheck object that users can create and add Appearances and Justifiacations to
explicitly rather than explicitly using Appearance Confirmation Votes and Justification Votes.
