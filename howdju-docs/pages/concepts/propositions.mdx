# Propositions

Propositions are concise, neutral point of view, unambiguous, declarative
clauses.

Propositions are the foundation of rational criticism because they ground
discourse in concrete phrasings. Until one has articulated what one is trying to say, it's very
difficult to have a meaningful conversation about truth.

Propositions are also the foundation of a
platform for communal criticism, because they are well-suited for automated
semantic similarity suggestions. By discovering equivalent and related propositions both
automatically and manually, we can ensure that justifications for their truth are consolidated.
This helps users to have confidence that they have seen representative variety of arguments for and
against the truth of a proposition.

## Attributes

- **Declarative clause:** a single independent clause that describes a factual state
  of affairs.
- **Acontextually Unambiguous:** if a person with reasonable knowledge of a
  proposition’s subject matter would be confused between multiple incompatible
  interpretations of the proposition without additional context, then other less
  confusing alternatives are preferred.
- **Neutral point of view:** if the same meaning is conveyed with alternative
  phrasing that is less offensive to some group, that phrasing is preferred.
- **Concise:** if the same meaning is conveyed with fewer or simpler words, that
  wording is preferred

## Relation to “claims”

Propositions are similar to what some people and other tools might call
“claims”. We chose the term "proposition" instead of "claim" to avoid ambiguity in how the term
"claim" can be used.

Sometimes the term "claim" means the underlying logical content. This is the
same meaning as Howdju's Proposition. Under this meaning, if two different sources make essentially
the same logical statement of fact, then they are the same claim and this is the same Proposition.

Another use of the term claim is to mean a particular statement of a Proposition: a fact-checker may
have be asked to find all the claims in two sources. Finding a similar statement in one source is a
different "claim" from finding it in another source.

A third meaning of the word claim is that a particular person espouses the truth of some
Proposition, often throughout time. "He claims A is the cause, but they claim B is the case.".

## Examples

These are examples of valid and invalid Propositions:

### Questions

Question: “Is the Burj Khalifa the tallest structure in the world?”

Correct: “The Burj Khalifa is the tallest structure in the world”

Reason: is not a declarative clause.

### Dependent clause

Incorrect: "That allowed the astronauts to reach the moon"

Correct: "NASA's advanced navigational system allowed the astronauts to reach the moon."

Reason: not an independent clause. The word "that" is a subordinating conjunction that makes the
clause depend on some other (unspoken) information.

### Free referants

Incorrect: "She rose to the position of CEO faster than any other person"

Correct: "Victoria Chen rose to the position of CEO faster than any other person"

Reason: the proposition "she" refers to an unknown person in the incorrect example.

### Multiple independent clauses

Incorrect: "Vajiralongkorn is the king of Thailand, and a protestor at the 2021 protest insulted
Vajiralongkorn."

Correct: two separate Propositions:

- "Vajiralongkorn is the king of Thailand"
- "A protestor at the 2021 protest insulted Vajiralongkorn."

### Ambiguous phrasing

Incorrect: "Paris is lovely"

Correct: "Paris, Franci is lovely"

Reason: the word "Paris" is ambiguous. It could mean Paris (France), Paris (Texas), Paris (Hilton) etc.

### NPOV

Incorrect: "The researcher made the stupid decision to combine the results"

Correct: "The researcher combined the results"

Reason: "stupid" is a condescending value judgment. If the decision was a bad one, the user should
figure out what the negative consequence was and argue that the researcher's decision led to the bad outcome.
