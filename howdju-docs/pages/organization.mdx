# Organization

Howdju currently has no formal legal entity, but these are the requirements of
any future organization:

- All income must come from sources that will preserve the platform's independent nature. The
  platform will not sell advertisements, but instead will receive donations and possibly offer
  subscription-only features targeting professional users.
- Profits will be reinvested into R&D for the platform and donated to causes relating to media
  literacy and critical thinking.
- Always develop source code in the open.
- Cooperate with researchers: work with sincere and qualified researchers to provide
  privacy-sensitive access to Howdju data in order to advance societal understanding.

A non-profit corporation structure would probably best serve these requirements.
