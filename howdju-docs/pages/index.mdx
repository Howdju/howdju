# Howdju's Docs

Howdju is a prototype platform for crowdsourced factchecking. Howdju's goal is to decrease
misunderstandings by making it convenient to access and share factual information relating to
debated topics.

Our [introduction](/introduction) explains ***why*** Howdju exists. Our [design page](/design)
explains ***what*** Howdju does and compares Howdju to related tools. Our [concepts page](/concepts)
explains ***how*** Howdju works.

Howdju was started by [Carl Gieringer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlgieringer/).

## Sophistree

The Sophistree Chrome extension is a related project for argument mapping.

- [Sophistree Github](https://www.github.com/carlgieringer/sophistree)
- [Sophistree Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sophistree/mjcdfjnpgilfkhnolcjellbknlehekem)

Sophistree is currently not integrated with Howdju, but my intention is to integrate Sophistree's
highlighting and mapping functionality with Howdju. Sophistree uses Howdju's [concepts and data model](http://docs.howdju.com/concepts).

## Prototype?

Prototype means:

- Functionality may be incomplete or unreliable
- Functionality may change with new ideas for how the platform should work.
