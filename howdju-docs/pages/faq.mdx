## How does Howdju expect to be effective if so few people bother to do a Google search before sharing a headline they see?

We hypothesize that Howdju does not need to be widely used in order to be effective. We hypothesize
that if a dedicated cadre of ‘citizen infoteers’ uses Howdju both to:

1. educate themselves to form justified background beliefs and
2. to find or recall factual support for their beliefs while engaged in debate,

then they can amplify Howdju‘s effect by connecting others to valid, factual, and informed
information. These infoteers will have a ‘misinformation innoculation’ effect through their social
interactions with groups that don‘t use Howdju directly.

## Will I be able to delete my Howdju content?

Howdju provides value by accepting user submitted content and allowing users to build on top of other user's submitted
content. Examples include one user adding a justification for another user's proposition, one user countering another
user's justification, or one user critiquing another user's summary justification. Such a system cannot reliably provide
value to its users if users remove their content because doing so would invalidate the content of other users
that was built on top of it. For that reason, content you submit to Howdju may persist indefinitely.

That said, Howdju recognizes the importance of allowing users to change their minds. We plan to support disassociating
a user from a particular piece of content. In the future we plan to support versioned edits.

If there are extenuating circumstances which require immediate disassociation of a user from content, or deletion of
content, please report the content or email us at <EmailAddress username="report" />.

## Will I be able to delete my Howdju account?

Howdju believes that the subjects with which a user chooses to interact and the ways that a user behaves provide
important context to understanding the user's motivations and authenticity. Other users deserve some ability to access
this context instead of seeing content divorced from the context of the person who was motivated to create it.

For this reason, Howdju plans to balance users' needs to disassociate themselves personally from Howdju and their created
content by replacing accounts with anonymized accounts rather than complete deletion. This approach allows other users
the opportunity to see the content in context, while disassociating the creator from the activity.

## Does Howdju sell my data?

Howdju will never sell personally indentifiable information, but we may sell aggregated information that cannot be
personally identified. For example, we will never sell information that would allow an advertiser to advertise to
a user based upon that user's activity on Howdju. But we may sell information about the probability of support between
non-identifiable groups for a proposition.

## Is the information on Howdju accurate?

Howdju provides a system for presenting viewpoints on uncertain or disputed topics. Howdju does not confirm the
expertise of the users who submit content, and we do not verify the accuracy of information submitted or of citations
used. Therefore, the information on Howdju should be used as a starting point for one's own research into the truth of any
particular topic. We hope that our system can help make your research efficient and enjoyable.

That said, Howdju is designed to be open to critique, so if a factually incorrect proposition appears on Howdju, other
users can add disjustifications to show that it is false. The reliability of such a system depends on users viewing
and adding such disjustifictions, and so Howdju attempts to provide proxies to help users understand the difference
between the cases when valid disjustifications don't exist and when users just haven't had the opportunity yet to add
disjustifications, such as how old a proposition is and how many unique persons have viewed it.

## Why can't Europeans create a Howdju account or submit content?

While we have attempted both to inform about and to provide control over our collection of personal information, Howdju
lacks the expertise or resources to confirm our compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation. We apologize for
any inconvenience, but we require that you not submit any personal information to Howdju if you are
subject to the GDPR. Please see [this Github issue](https://github.com/Howdju/howdju/issues/24) for
more background.
