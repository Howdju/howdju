# Media Excerpts

Media Excerpts are references to a part of some media external to Howdju. They have local
represenatations and remote locators:

- Local representations allow users to assess the evidentiary quality of the excerpt without leaving Howdju.
- Remote locators allow users to access the excerpt in its original context.

## Citations

Citations are remote locators that use bibliographic source citations to locate excerpts.
They enable locating material which may not be available online or which the user may not know how
to find online.

Citations consist of a Source and an optional Pincite.

### Sources

Sources are like bibliographic sources that would appear in a research paper. They have a textual
description, which is MLA-like except that it omits the authors.

Source's vs. Source containers

### Pincites

A Citation may optionally contain a Pincite which is a textual directive to help a user locate
(“pinpoint”) a MediaExcerpt in a cited Source.

Examples of Pincites include:

- Page number
- Video/Audio timestamp

## Speakers

A MediaExcept may be associated with one or more speakers.

### Persorgs

Persorgs are something capable of making speech: a natural person or an organization.
