# Justifications

A justification is when one thing makes another thing more likely to be valid or true. A justification represents a userâ€™s intention to express or a belief in a relationship between a basis and an target. The basis is the starting point and the target is the conclusion arrived at by inference.

Justifications represent a grounded implication of the truth of some target. One type of target is a proposition: the justification represents reasons for believing that the proposition is true or false. The basis may be external evidence or other propositions on the platform.

Justifications are the foundation of knowledge construction.
