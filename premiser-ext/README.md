# Howdju Chrome Extension

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

For development, you need to load it as an unpacked extension:

For production, [publish to the Chrome Web Store](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish). You can keep the extension unlisted (no one can search for it) or [private](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2663860?hl=en) (people have to be added to a Google group to see it).
