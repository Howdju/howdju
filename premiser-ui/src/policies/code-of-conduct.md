# Howdju Code of Conduct

Last Updated 6 July 2021

Howdju wants to make the process of presenting alternative viewpoints and verifying claims relating to them efficient and enjoyable. This goal is only possible through the hard work and cooperation of the many people who can represent those viewpoints. If you see anything on Howdju that
violates this Code of Conduct, please report it using the provided functionality, or email <span data-type="email" data-email-user="report" data-email-domain="howdju.com"></span> with a link to the content and an explanation of the problem.

This Code of Conduct helps you understand what behaviors are desirable and which are unacceptable when using Howdju. Please note that engaging in unacceptable behavior constitutes grounds for temporary suspension or permanent account termination.

This Code of Conduct is part of our [User Agreement](/policies/user-agreement).

## Things you should do

- Submit only content you believe in good faith to be beneficial to understanding truth.
- Phrase all propositions and summaries using a neutral point of view.
- Ensure that all citations accurately reflect the source material
- Recognize that billions of people will have a diversity of backgrounds and viewpoints. Focus less on someone's beliefs that may contradict your own, but instead on why they believe that.
- Consider the steel person argument: if you were to imagine a conflicting viewpoint in its most charitable form, what criticism could you offer? Don't waste your own or other's time countering justifications that are irrelevant because a stronger alternative is readily apparent to those who invest a little effort.
- Please submit content using primarily English language vocabulary and grammar, as our resources to moderate non-English language content is limited. Incidental usage of non-English words or well known non-English phrases in primarily English language content is no problem.

## Things you must not do

### Illegal Use

Howdju may not be used for illegal purposes. Examples of this include using Howdju for fraudulent purposes or operating a phishing site (used to obtain account and password information).

### Spam and Affiliate Marketing

You may not create content that is inconsistent with or detrimental to Howdju’s design and purpose, and you may not use deceptive means to generate revenue or traffic.

Examples include: content the primary purpose of which is advertising (promoting awareness of rather than informing factually about); content the primary purpose of which is search engine optimization, such as term stuffing content in a way that detracts from it’s informational content; content containing affiliate marketing links; content that is meaningless or nonsensical in the context.

### Identity Theft and Privacy

You may not misleadingly appropriate the identity of another person or otherwise misrepresent your identity, affiliation or status. You may not post other people's personally identifying or confidential information, including but not limited to credit card numbers, Social Security Numbers, and driver's and other license numbers. You may not post personal information such as other people's passwords, usernames, phone numbers, addresses and e-mail addresses.

An exception to these restrictions is that you may create content containing personally identifying information of public figures when such information is already public and relates to a publicly relevant matter of fact. You must only include the minimum amount of personal information in order to inform understanding of that matter of fact.

You must not solicit personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18 for an illegal purpose or violate any applicable law regarding the health or well-being of minors.

### Hate Content

You must not submit content that is intended to harm rather than to inform. Ad-hominem attacks are not allowed, and explicit, pejorative, or derogatory language is not allowed. If such content contains any redeemable information, it likely could be restated from a neutral point of view.

### Defamation, Libel, False Statements, and Fraud

You must not submit content that is unlawful, defamatory, or fraudulent, and must not post content that is false or inaccurate with the intent to deceive.

You must not engage in fraud, and must not attempt to impersonate another user or individual, misrepresent their affiliation with any individual or entity, or use the identifiers of another user with the intent to deceive.

An allegation of defamatory expression, in and of itself, does not establish defamation. The truth or falsehood of an expression is a key element in establishing defamation, and we are not in a position to make that sort of fact-based judgment. That said, if we have reason to believe that a particular statement is defamatory (a court order, for example), we may remove that statement.

### Disruptions and Exploits

We will terminate accounts and block addresses of those who attempt unauthorized use of the Howdju Services.

### Intellectual Property Infringement

You must not infringe copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other proprietary rights under applicable law.

Using copyrighted material does not constitute infringement in all cases. In general, however, you should be careful when using copyrighted content without the permission of those who created it. It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement sent to
<span data-type="email" data-email-user="legal" data-email-domain="howdju.com"></span> that comply with the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA").

### Automation and Mass Registration

You may not use automated means to upload, or to distribute or otherwise to publish, content onto the Services, unless such automation merely transmits content you generate manually, at the same time, and in a 1-to-1 manner. Accounts that are registered automatically or systematically will be removed and access will be permanently suspended.

### Obscene, Sexually Explicit, Excessively Violent, and Gory Material

You may not post obscene, sexually explicit or pornographic material, or links to it. You may not submit sexually suggestive content involving minors.

### Paid contributions without disclosure

If you receive, or expect to receive, any compensation for any actions you take using the Services, you must disclose this on your profile page. You must list all employers, clients, or affiliations from which you receive, or expect to receive, compensation, and you must list the topics about which the payments relate. An example disclosure is the following: “I receive compensation from Company A for my content relating to topics X, Y, and Z.” Your paid contribution disclosure will remain on your anonymized profile page after your account is deleted.

Applicable law, such as those addressing conflicts of interest, may further limit paid contributions or require more detailed disclosure.

## Consequences

We reserve the right to immediately suspend, remove or terminate, without notice, any content, account, or IP address which we determine to be violating this Code of Conduct or otherwise disrupting the Services. When your account is suspended, public access to content contributed under that account may be blocked or removed, and your account may be suspended or deleted at our discretion. Access to other functionality or information within the Services may also be blocked or disabled.
