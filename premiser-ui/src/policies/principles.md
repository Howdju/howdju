# Howdju's principles

## Mission

Howdju's mission is to minimize the time required to understand representative viewpoints about uncertain or disputed topics.

## Vision

Howdju's vision is a world where people rarely disagree based upon misunderstandings, but instead genuinely understand
the viewpoints of those with different beliefs than their own.

## Values

Howdju has adopted the following values which support our mission:

### Autonomy

Many of us are often most happy when we have the individual prerogative to choose our own destiny. Communities are
healthiest when their members feel free to speak and act upon their own conscience.

### Transparency

In order for individuals to make informed decisions, there must be transparency in providing them with accurate
information.

### Accountability

Individuals and organizations should own up to their speech and action. The source of both beneficial and harmful
effects should be made clear, and those responsible should reap the rewards.

### Honesty

We should all strive to be truthful to ourselves and each other.

### Grit

We should each push ourselves to be the best versions of ourselves that we can be, even when that may be challenging.
We should strive for achievements that are larger than ourselves, and dedicate ourselves to greater goods.

### Innovation

We should strive to see the world in new ways and to push the horizons of our capabilities and understanding.

### Open-mindedness

The hallmark of an illuminated mind is the ability to entertain an idea without accepting it.

### Respect

We should appreciate the diversity of the world, including its opinions, and not be closed to those opinions that,
while different to our own, do not harm us. Each person has the right to exist and follow their dreams.

### Forgiveness

We should acknowledge that the world is a changing place, including our own minds and opinions and the minds of others.
We all make mistakes, and the world will be a bettter place if we make space for people to take accountability for those
mistakes and to move on, rather than to adhere to limited beliefs about others potential.

Give people the benefit of the doubt; they may act the better because of it.

### Sustainability

We should act in such a way that our Earth and civilization will remain vibrant and thrive for future generations.
