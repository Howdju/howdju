# What’s Next

Howdju is an open source software project ([github](https://github.com/Howdju/howdju/)). You can
browse our [open issues](https://github.com/Howdju/howdju/issues) to get an idea of the direction of
the prototype. Here are some
focused ways to view issues:

- [Core domain](https://github.com/Howdju/howdju/labels/core%20domain): these are the work items
  that relate to Howdju‘s primary fact-checking functionality.
- [Assigned to Carl](https://github.com/Howdju/howdju/issues/assigned/carlgieringer) these are
  issues I'm actively working on or that I intend to work on soon.
- [In the Add Appearances project](https://github.com/orgs/Howdju/projects/3): this is a Kanban
  board that contains similar issues to those assigned to Carl.
- [Good first issues](https://github.com/Howdju/howdju/labels/good%20first%20issue): Howdju welcomes
  contributions! Carl is happy to explain the platform and the development process to newcomers. I
  am also happy to talk through ideas for features and implementation approaches.

The current general direction is to evaluate and improve the social fact-checking functionality.

Please [join Howdju’s
slack](https://join.slack.com/t/howdju/shared_invite/zt-1qbfzlfsj-YRswgQ5RCLDHelef6ya6xg) if you
would like to meet or discuss Howdju, fact-checking, or any interesting topic approached with an
open mind and in good faith.
