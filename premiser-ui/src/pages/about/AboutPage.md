# About Howdju

Howdju is a prototype of a platform by [Carl Gieringer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlgieringer/).

## Goals

The goals of the platform are to decrease misunderstandings by making it convenient to access and
share factual information relating to debated topics.

## Hypotheses

Howdju is based upon on these hypotheses:

- We are more open to alternative perspectives when we share why we believe what we believe than
  when we are told what is correct or incorrect. (The name “Howdju” comes from “How d’you know
  that…?”)
- Doubt and resistance will persist until we are confident that all sides have had an opportunity
  to present alternative perspectives and respond to others’ perspectives.
- To maintain trust and accountability, a human-centered aggregatator must be in the loop of any AI
  generated information.

## Intended features

The platform’s primary intended features are:

- Store propositions, which are concise, neutral point of view, unambiguous, declarative clauses.
- Collect evidence and arguments justifying the truth of propositions. Evidence is excerpts from
  media (e.g. quotations.) Arguments are ordered lists of propositions.
- Rank justifications according to voting and clustering of users.
- Consolidate justifications of equivalent propositions and reveal related propositions and
  justifications.
- Associate propositions with media excerpts to evaluate the truth of sources in situ and their
  speakers’ credibility.
- Provide tools for viewing evidence in-context, including text fragment link support, a browser
  extension, and a mobile app.
- Notify users when relevant events occur

## Intended qualities

Howdju’s intended qualities are:

- Convenience: make it easy to submit information and to access information
- Consolidation: don’t allow users to create equivalent entities; for related but non-equivalent
  entities, surface their existence and recommend users to reuse them.
- Context: design the site to increase context:
  - Context trail
  - Entity metadata
    - Autoconfirmation
    - User, group, global
  - Text fragment links

## Intended organization

Howdju’s intended organization is as a non-profit:

- All income must come from sources that will preserve the platform's independent nature. The
  platform will not sell advertisements, but instead will receive donations and possibly offer
  subscription-only features appropriate for organizations.
- Profits will be reinvested into R&D for the platform or donated to causes relating to media
  literacy and critical thinking.
- An [open source software project](https://github.com/Howdju/howdju/)
- Cooperate with researchers: work with sincere and qualified researchers to provide
  privacy-sensitive access to Howdju data in order to advance societal understanding.

## Prototype?

By prototype, I mean that:

- Functionality may be incomplete or unreliable
- Functionality may change as I come up with new ideas for how the platform should work.

## Background

Information online is growing quickly. Besides the large amount of information generated daily by
traditional news and institutional sources, social media and a variety of new media sources are
generating information faster than the average person can keep up. New tools are needed to help
people aggregate and filter the content that is most relevant to them and to help them to evalute
new information efficiently.

One of the greatest impediments to human well-being is lack of mutual understanding. Howdju is
designed to expose users to alternative viewpoints to try and help people to understand better where
the other is coming from. It is also intended to provide people the best information to evaluate
different perspectives on issues to help inform their dialog.

Howdju is a platform to help people stay informed. Its primary objective is to help people
effectively understand the massive amount of information that we increasingly need to digest to make
decisions about our lives. Howdju’s vision is both to help people remain informed about the high
level events and currents of our societies, while allowing them to dig deeply into the specifics of
those events, all while helping us to keep track of what was learned.

### Research supports this approach

[Research](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23808985.1999.11678963 "Daniel J. O’Keefe (1999) How to Handle
Opposing Arguments in Persuasive Messages: A Meta-Analytic Review of the Effects of One-Sided and
Two-Sided Messages, Annals of the International Communication Association, 22:1, 209-249, DOI:
10.1080/23808985.1999.11678963") indicates that two-sided messaging that includes counter-arguments
is much more persuasive than without.
[Research](https://www.poynter.org/news/fact-checking-doesnt-backfire-new-study-suggests "Fact-checking doesn't 'backfire,' new study suggests, Alexios Mantzarlis, November 2, 2016 citing
Wood, Thomas and Porter, Ethan, The Elusive Backfire Effect: Mass Attitudes’ Steadfast Factual
Adherence (December 31, 2017)") also indicates that the “backfire effect” may occur for isolated
incidents based upon wording of the correction. “[B]y and large, citizens heed factual information,
even when such information challenges their partisan and ideological commitments.”

### Democracy & social cohesion

Democratic government depends upon its citizens getting good information in a timely fashion. If
citizens do not receive good information when they need it, or, worse, if they receive bad
information, then democratic government suffers. Special interests that do not necessarily reflect
the best interests of a country can influence opinion with bad information, leading to the break
down of the concensus which is necessary for democratic government to survive.

As societies grow in population, citizens grow increasingly disconnected from each other. This is
just an outcome of the limit on the human ability to maintain relationships and keep track of
information. At the same time, as technology advances, a society’s ability to create and share
information increases. But a society’s ability to separate good information from bad information
does not necessarily grow at the same time. This creates a dangerous situation where segments of the
population can become disconnected from one another in opinion, based upon a lack of consensus of
what is true.

In smaller, less technologically advanced societies, social cohesion was created by a combination of
editorialization and citizen communication. These two channels of verifying information cannot keep
up with a growing society: technology has weakened the power of editorialization, both for good and
for bad. Now that anyone can create “news” in a few easy steps (1. register a domain, 2. perform a
few clicks to install a blogging platform with a professional theme, 3. write anything you want at
all, 4. share via social media and/or advertising.) it can be difficult to tell the good news from
the bad. Growing population has weakened citizen communication.

Assuming increasing population growth and technological advancement, democratic governments must
discover ways to balance the influence of bad information. The thesis of Howdju is that in order to
do so, a system must bring together all the information, both the good and the bad, present them
side-by-side, and provide tools for tracking the good and the bad information.
