        Howdju is a platform to fight disinformation online premised upon three hypotheses:
        <ol>
          <li>
            We are more open to alternative perspectives when we share why we believe what
            we believe than when we are told what is correct or incorrect. (&ldquo;How d'ya know that&ellip;?&rdquo;)
          </li>
          <li>
            Doubt and resistance will persist until we we are confident that all sides have had an opportunity
            to present all perspectives and respond to others' perspectives.
          </li>
          <li>
            We need an efficient way to evaluate new information, because fact-checking everything would take too
            much time.
          </li>
        </ol>

        Information online is growing fast.  Besides the huge number of facts generated daily by traditional sources
        social media and a menagerie of new media sources are generating information faster than the average person can
        keep up.  How to

        The two greatest threats to humans are nuclear war and lack of mutual understanding.  Representative
        democracy, which balances power between different elements of society, is the cure to the first.  Howdju is the
        cure to the second.

        Howdju is a platform to help people stay informed.  Its primary objective is to help people effectively understand
        the massive amount of information that we increasingly need to digest to make decisions about our lives.  Howdju's
        vision is both to help people remain informed about the high level events and currents of our societies (the forest),
        while allowing them to dig deeply into the specifics of those events, all while helping us to keep track of what
        was learned.

      <CardText>
        Howdju is one take on distilling the fundamental components of truth and turning it into an online platform that
        anyone can use and share their work with others.

        <h2>Justifications</h2>

        <h3>Justification bases and targets</h3>
        Justifications are connections between facts
        Justifications draw support from a basis (plural, bases.)  They impute that truth to their target.  The quality
        of the justification depends upon whether the basis is aptly chosen for the target.

        <h4>Citation basis</h4>
        A citation is some reference to an external source of information.  In our day-to-day lives when we refer to
        books, news articles, expert opinion, research, etc. we are citing these sources of information to support
        some conclusion.  The strength of the support depends on how reliable we think the cited source is.  If we have
        a good reason to believe that the cited source is accurate.  See below for details on the nature of good sources.

        <h4>Statements basis</h4>



        <h4>Statement target</h4>
        When justifications target statements, they attempt to impute their basis to either prove that the statement is
        true (if it is a supporting justification) or that the statement is false (if it is an oppositing justification.)

        <h4>Counter-justifications</h4>
        Justifications can also be used to weaken other justifications.  Just like a counter-argument is an organized
        set of thoughts against some proposition, a counter-justification is intended to show someone how a justification
        is actually not as effective as it otherwise appeared.

        <h3>Good sources</h3>
        Good sources come from experts who have spent time studying the matter, who are in a position to be impartial,
        and who present the information in a way that supports scrutiny over time.

        <h4>Scrutiny over time</h4>
        One of the best indicators that a source of information is good is that it has been widely known for a long time
        but not shown to be false.  It must be widely known and published so that people can have attempted to find any
        inaccuracies.  And of course no one must have found any glaring problems.  The more amenable to criticism the
        source is, the more reliable its information.  If it has been widely published, but not in a way that was open
        to published counter-scrutiny, then there may be problems with the source that are not known.  This characteristic
        is one of the fundamental design principles of Howdju: everyone can access the information on
        howdju.com, and anyone can instantly publish critical analysis globally.



        <h2>Democracy</h2>
        <p>
          Democratic government depends upon its citizens getting good information in a timely fashion.  If citizens
          do not receive good information when they need it, or, worse, if they receive bad information, then
          democratic government suffers.  Special interests that do not necessarily reflect the best interests of a
          country can influence opinion with bad information, leading to the break down of the concensus which is
          necessary for democratic government to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          As societies grow in population, citizens grow increasingly disconnected from each other.  This is just an
          outcome of the limit on the human ability to maintain relationships and keep track of information.  At the
          same time, as technology advances, a society's ability to create and share information increases.  But
          a society's ability to separate good information from bad information does not necessarily grow at the same time.
          This creates a dangerous situation where segments of the population can become disconnected from one another
          in opinion, based upon a lack of consensus of what is true.
        </p>
        <p>
          In smaller, less technologically advanced societies, social cohesion was created by a combination of
          editorialization and citizen communication.  These two channels of verifying information cannot keep up with
          a growing society: technology has weakened the power of editorialization, both for good and for bad.  Now
          that anyone can create "news" in a few easy steps (1. register a domain,
          2. perform a few clicks to install a blogging platform with a professional theme, 3. write anything you want
          at all, 4. share via social media and/or advertising.) it can be difficult to tell the good news from the bad.
          Growing population has weakened citizen communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assuming increasing population growth and technological advancement, democratic governments must discover ways
          to balance the influence of bad information. The thesis of Howdju is that in order to do so, a system must
          bring together all the information, both the good and the bad, present them side-by-side, and provide tools
          for tracking the good and the bad information.
