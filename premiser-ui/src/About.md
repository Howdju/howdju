# About Howdju

Howdju is a platform for countering misunderstanding based upon three hypotheses:

1. We are more open to alternative perspectives when we share why we believe what we believe than when we are told what
   is correct or incorrect. (“How d’ya know that…?”)
2. Doubt and resistance will persist until we are confident that all sides have had an opportunity to present alternative
   perspectives and respond to others’ perspectives.
3. We need a human-centered aggregatator that focuses on the efficient transmission .

## Research supports this approach

[Research](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23808985.1999.11678963 "Daniel J. O’Keefe (1999) How to Handle Opposing Arguments
in Persuasive Messages: A Meta-Analytic Review of the Effects of One-Sided and Two-Sided Messages, Annals of the
International Communication Association, 22:1, 209-249, DOI: 10.1080/23808985.1999.11678963") indicates that two-sided
messaging that includes counter-arguments is much more persuasive than without.

'backfire,' new study suggests, Alexios Mantzarlis, November 2, 2016 citing Wood, Thomas and Porter, Ethan, The Elusive

effect” may occur for isolated incidents based upon wording of the correction. “[B]y and large, citizens heed factual
information, even when such information challenges their partisan and ideological commitments.”

## Introduction

Information online is growing quickly. Besides the large amount of information generated daily by traditional news and
institutional sources, social media and a variety of new media sources are generating information faster than the
average person can keep up. New tools are needed to help people aggregate and filter the content that is most relevant
to them and to help them to evalute new information efficiently.

One of the greatest impediments to human well-being is lack of mutual understanding. Howdju is designed to expose users
to alternative viewpoints to try and help people to understand better where the other is coming from. It is also
intended to provide people the best information to evaluate different perspectives on issues to help inform their
dialog.

Howdju is a platform to help people stay informed. Its primary objective is to help people effectively understand the
massive amount of information that we increasingly need to digest to make decisions about our lives. Howdju’s vision is
both to help people remain informed about the high level events and currents of our societies, while allowing them to
dig deeply into the specifics of those events, all while helping us to keep track of what was learned.

## Howdju’s goals

- Collect the best information
- Empower people to have conversations based upon the best information
- Inform people when events relevant to their interests occur
- Help people keep track of things they want to follow up on later

## Democracy & social cohesion

Democratic government depends upon its citizens getting good information in a timely fashion. If citizens do not receive
good information when they need it, or, worse, if they receive bad information, then democratic government suffers.
Special interests that do not necessarily reflect the best interests of a country can influence opinion with bad
information, leading to the break down of the concensus which is necessary for democratic government to survive.

As societies grow in population, citizens grow increasingly disconnected from each other. This is just an outcome of the
limit on the human ability to maintain relationships and keep track of information. At the same time, as technology
advances, a society’s ability to create and share information increases. But a society’s ability to separate good
information from bad information does not necessarily grow at the same time. This creates a dangerous situation where
segments of the population can become disconnected from one another in opinion, based upon a lack of consensus of what
is true.

In smaller, less technologically advanced societies, social cohesion was created by a combination of editorialization
and citizen communication. These two channels of verifying information cannot keep up with a growing society: technology
has weakened the power of editorialization, both for good and for bad. Now that anyone can create “news” in a few easy
steps (1. register a domain, 2. perform a few clicks to install a blogging platform with a professional theme, 3. write
anything you want at all, 4. share via social media and/or advertising.) it can be difficult to tell the good news from
the bad. Growing population has weakened citizen communication.

Assuming increasing population growth and technological advancement, democratic governments must discover ways to
balance the influence of bad information. The thesis of Howdju is that in order to do so, a system must bring together
all the information, both the good and the bad, present them side-by-side, and provide tools for tracking the good and
the bad information.
