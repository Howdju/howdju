# Howdju UI TODO
## MVP

### Features

* main search autocomplete

* bookmarklet

* tagging
* Author of quote

* Jobs (justification score)
* Home page tag cloud
* Analyze sources
  * See list of all domains cited; search cited domains.
  * See citations (quotes?) and/or citations supported by domain name
  * How to evaluate the truthiness of a quote from a URL
    * How to tell when text on a page is a quotation rather than a direct statement
      * X said
      * quotation marks
* favicon

### Bugs/stability
* Why are IDs sometimes strings and sometimes ints?
* Figure out if the site works in Firefox
* Test with mobile device
* flag rehydrate after a timeout (sometimes rehydrate not flagged and API calls hang)
  * Sometimes verification becomes unresponsive UNTIL you open the nav drawer...
* can create two statements that only differ by apostrophe types (' vs. â€™)

### Feedback
* Error reporting
  * feedback script; 
  * unhandled error reporting
  * ensure that log level in prod is at least debug

### Misc.
* UI Build
  * ensure that CSS goes to external sheet
  * ensure that google fonts go to external link?

* Why do I have PostCSS in my project?

## 0.2

### Features
* add citation text to main search?
* Allow collapsing counter justifications
* Change email, password, password reset
* Timeout authentication
* Loading flags (vs. just empty return from API)
* Statement example: height of the capitol building limit DC
  
### Flair
  * Rotate placeholder of mainSearch to be popular statements: howdju know that "blah blah blah"

### Refactoring/stability
* Refactor tests to use helpers to cut down on setup noise
* Immutable refactor
  * [React App best practices](https://tonyhb.gitbooks.io/redux-without-profanity/content/transforming_state_per_component.html)
* rename justificationsByRootStatementId to rootJustificationsByRootStatementId?
* add rootStatement as a schema property of justifications?
* simplify reducer by merging all payload.entities?
* Clone normalizr and add capability to set prototype of objects generated by a schema
  * Move logic from models.js into prototypes

### UX
* Allow creating multiple counter-justifications at a time
* Statement justification drilling down
  * link to own statement page
  * show in-context
  * drill down, showing hierarchy of statements above
* Get statement to stay in place and float above justifications? Or maybe collapse to something 
  smaller, but that lets you see the statement still as you scroll.  maybe combine with header.
* Create statement brilliance:
  * reset state (statement, error) if they navigate away
  * warn if they try and navigate away after entering text
  * When statement already exists, tell them that on the create page and offer link to go there
  * When attempting to create a statement that already exists, redirect them to it with a message that it already exists

### UI
* Counter-justification creation:
  * When creating a counter-justification, if the new justification will be at the top, the new justification should
    replace the editor.  E.g., when there are no counter justifications.
  * When created counter-justification is initially inserted, this may not be the same location it appears on a full
     page reload.

### Product/Modeling ideas
* Disjustifications of a statement are counters to a justification using that statement
  
### Error/Requirements
* Do required fields on either justification editor prevent submission?
* When FETCH_STATEMENT_JUSTIFICATIONS_FAILED, no error message on page (didFail is never true)
* Am I transitioning color on the verification icons?
* Require statement to be non-empty, or >3 words?

### Misc.
* CSS
  * React-MD recommends: https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer
  * dppx
  * [vw/vh](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#viewport-relative-lengths)
