# Howdju UI TODO
## MVP

### Editors/Errors
* Disable submit and edits while submitting editors
  * property for entity type and id, so that can watch FETCH actions and show spinner?
* Autocomplete doesn't hide after searching
  * reappears after clicking on search page (should only reappear upon typing)

### Strong validation
* Can only delete bases (justifications/quotes) if other users haven't used them as bases
  * If super user deletes them, must cascade delete to justifications
  * Can't delete justifications if other users have voted or countered them
  * if delete justification, must delete counters
* Update/Delete validation rules
  _ If modification would conflict with another entity, then disallow
  - If user has permission to MODIFY_ALL_ENTITIES, then allow
  - If other users have interacted with the entity, then disallow
  - If a grace period of 24 hours or so has passed, then disallow
  
* simplify reducer by merging all payload.entities?

### Features
    
* Show statements justified by statement

* bookmarklet
  * https://chriszarate.github.io/bookmarkleter/
  * https://www.labnol.org/internet/better-twitter-bookmarklet/28028/

* can create two statements that only differ by apostrophe types (' vs. â€™), probably whitespace, too.
* Can counter justification with same statement as basis for target justification
* Add linting 
  * https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-lodash-fp

* Search for payload.entities and find a way to factor out all these calls getting particular entities from the API results
  * Or should we not be normalizing from API?  Should we normalize in reducer?
  * Change this for autocomplete fetches in entities

* Jobs (justification score)
* favicon
* Stop API and load statement justifications page.  State shows didFail: true, but UI doesn't reflect it
* Statements that differ by special chars or capitalization are treated as different (normalized text etc)
  * https://lodash.com/docs/#deburr
  
* Statement example: height of the capitol building limit DC
  
### Feedback
* Error reporting
  * feedback script; 
  * unhandled error reporting
  * ensure that log level in prod is at least debug




### Bugs/stability
* Difficult to distinguish citationReference having only citation.text from statement justification
* Validation belongs in route.js, I think
  * Include type conversion in validation somehow?  toNumber(statementId), e.g.
* Simplify sagas like login/logout at bottom here: https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/blob/master/docs/advanced/FutureActions.md
* Reuse code between client/server (Use same javascript syntax in client/server.)  
  * https://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html
* don't let a user edit their own entities when they are older than a certain age
* replace regex with path-to-regexp
* What happens if we justify a statement with itself?
* Autocomplete
  * Does not appear above dialog
    * [Fix in react-md 1.1](https://github.com/mlaursen/react-md/issues/232)
  * branch react-md and add features like [react-autocomplete](https://github.com/reactjs/react-autocomplete)
* Why are IDs sometimes strings and sometimes ints?  (e.g., reducers.entities.DELETE_STATEMENT_SUCCESS)
  * They will be strings when component props and object keys
* Figure out if the site works in Firefox
* Test with mobile device
* flag rehydrate after a timeout (sometimes rehydrate not flagged and API calls hang)
  * Sometimes verification becomes unresponsive UNTIL you open the nav drawer...
* Adding maxlength to StatementTextAutocompleter on create justification dialog creates horizontal scrollbar
* If there's a parse error in route.js, then we get an error that headers cant be set after they are sent.
* Do I check return values for delete dao methods and throw NotFoundError when it was missing?

### Misc.
* UI Build
  * ensure that CSS goes to external sheet
  * ensure that google fonts go to external link?
* CitationReference update
  * want to use the same schema for data submitted as data returned (why?) or at least same data shape
  * reducers.entities if we just know which entities are returned from which success actions, we can automatically respond

* Why do I have PostCSS in my project?

## 0.2

### Editors
* Separate JustificationWithCounters into JustificationCard and JustificationTree/CounteredJustification/Argument
  * challenge of card having buttons to create counter
  
### Features
* JustificationBasisType.List 
  * A list of purported examples of something with links to prove their existence
  * [{text, urls}, ...]
* warn if they try and navigate away after entering text
* Add delete statement/justification confirmation (or better, undo)
* Author of quote
* tagging
  * Home page tag cloud
* Make URLs (or CitationUrls) voteable.
  * Users can always add new URLs
  * Deleting URLs follow the normal rules (if other users have interacted, or grace period is up)
  * Votes determine order of URLs
* Justification bases
  * Button to show image/video URL in-context
  * JustificationBasisType.IMAGE
  * JustificationBasisType.VIDEO
* Analyze sources
  * See list of all domains cited; search cited domains.
  * See citations (quotes?) and/or citations supported by domain name
  * How to evaluate the truthiness of a quote from a URL
    * How to tell when text on a page is a quotation rather than a direct statement
      * X said
      * quotation marks
* Recent votes: see what statement justifications look like when limited to a time period, either pre-selected time periods or according to the 'most recent activity' however recent that most recent activity is
* Main search:
  * citation text
  * url
  * author
  * tags
* Disable (with help text explaining why disabled) context menu items based upon permissions/ability to do the action
* Allow collapsing counter justifications
* User registration
  * Change email, password, password reset
* Timeout authentication

* Add messages for when cannot edit and why
* When statements or citations or citation references conflict, offer to merge them somehow?
* Add time grade period checks to entity update methods

### Improvements
* Client validation
  * http://redux-form.com/6.8.0/docs/GettingStarted.md/
Change submit button message to "create justification" when statement exists
  * Add link to statement when statement exists

### Flair
  * Rotate placeholder of mainSearch to be popular statements: howdju know that "blah blah blah"

### Refactoring/stability
* Refactor tests to use helpers to cut down on setup noise
* Immutable refactor
  * [React App best practices](https://tonyhb.gitbooks.io/redux-without-profanity/content/transforming_state_per_component.html)
* rename justificationsByRootStatementId to rootJustificationsByRootStatementId?
* Clone normalizr and add capability to set prototype of objects generated by a schema
  * Move logic from models.js into prototypes
* Why store statement autocomplete suggestions in redux?  They are transient; just make them state
  * Or somehow reset them, like navigating away from page

### UX
* Statement justification drilling down
  * When goto statement, show hierarchy of statements above
  * show sub-justifications in-context
* Hover statement when scrolling through its justifications
  * Get statement to stay in place and float above justifications? Or maybe collapse to something 
    smaller, but that lets you see the statement still as you scroll.  maybe combine with header.

### UI
* Counter-justification creation:
  * When creating a counter-justification, if the new justification will be at the top, the new justification should
    replace the editor.  E.g., when there are no counter justifications.
  * When created counter-justification is initially inserted, this may not be the same location it appears on a full
     page reload.

### Product/Modeling ideas
* Disjustifications of a statement are counters to a justification using that statement
  
### Bugs
* react-md autocomplete still shows when there are no results
* disverified negative justification causes horizontal scrollbar
  
### Error/Requirements
* Am I transitioning color on the verification icons?
* Require statement to be non-empty, or >3 words?

### Misc.
* CSS
  * React-MD recommends: https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer
  * dppx
  * [vw/vh](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#viewport-relative-lengths)
